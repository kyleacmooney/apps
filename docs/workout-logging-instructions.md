# Workout Logging to Supabase

Instructions for Claude.ai to log workout sessions to the Supabase database (project ID: `svmjtlsdyghxilpcdywc`) using `Supabase:execute_sql`. Use a single `DO $$ ... $$` block to insert everything atomically.

## Schema: 3 tables

### `workout_sessions` — one row per session

- `date` (date, use correct year — currently 2026), `time_of_day` (text: morning/afternoon/evening/night), `title` (text), `location` (text: 'apartment gym', 'LA Fitness', 'home'), `session_type` (enum: workout/mobility/grip_training/sitting_practice/mixed), `energy_level` (energy_level enum: low/moderate/high/full_send, nullable), `energy_rating` (smallint 1–10, nullable — ask at end of session), `body_state` (body_state enum: fresh/sore/tight/beat_up/recovering, nullable), `notes` (text — overall takeaways, PRs, injuries)

### `workout_exercises` — one row per exercise in the session

- `session_id` (FK), `exercise_id` (FK to exercises table, nullable — only link if the exercise exists in the encyclopedia), `exercise_name` (text, always populated), `section` (enum: warmup/main/accessory/cooldown), `position` (smallint — ordering within session, sequential starting at 1), `notes` (text, nullable)

### `workout_sets` — one row per set

- `workout_exercise_id` (FK), `set_number` (smallint), `reps` (smallint, nullable), `weight` (numeric, nullable), `weight_unit` (text, default 'lb'), `duration_seconds` (smallint, nullable), `is_pr` (boolean, default false), `notes` (text, nullable)

## Key rules

- Query the `exercises` table first to get current IDs for linking `exercise_id` where applicable
- Use nullable fields appropriately: reps-only exercises (pushups, dead bugs) have NULL weight/duration; timed exercises (hangs, wall sits) have NULL reps; carries have both duration and weight; stretches in cooldown may have no sets at all
- Flag PRs with `is_pr = true` and add context in set-level `notes`
- For drop sets like "9 @ 75 + 3 @ 67.5", create two separate set rows with sequential set_numbers and note "drop set" on the second
- For bilateral exercises like pallof press, note "each side" in set notes
- Session `notes` should contain the summary/takeaways paragraph
- Always use year 2026 for dates (not 2025)
- Use 'workout' only when the session's primary purpose is structured lifting/training. If the primary purpose is mobility/stretches and only includes a minor exercise component (e.g., a quick baseline test, a single accessory movement), use 'mixed' instead.
- "mixed" is only for non-workout combos (e.g., standalone grip + mobility in one session).
- Ask about both `energy_level` and `body_state` at the start or end of each session. Both are nullable — skip if the person doesn't volunteer it.
- At the end of each workout session, ask for an energy_rating (1–10) reflecting how the person felt during the session (also nullable).

## Adding exercises to the encyclopedia

When logging a workout, if an exercise (including stretches and mobility work) doesn't already exist in the `exercises` table, add it before logging the session. Use `Supabase:execute_sql` to insert.

### `exercises` table schema

- `id` (uuid PK, default gen_random_uuid()), `name` (text, unique), `category` (exercise_category enum), `form_cues` (text, nullable), `common_mistakes` (text, nullable), `current_working` (text, nullable), `progression` (text, nullable), `detailed_walkthrough` (text, nullable), `personal_notes` (text, nullable), `created_at`/`updated_at` (timestamptz, default now())

### Category enum values

'Upper Pull', 'Upper Push', 'Lower', 'Core', 'Mobility & Posture', 'Grip', 'Cardio & Conditioning', 'Neck'

### Rules

- Add all exercises including stretches and mobility work — stretches go under 'Mobility & Posture' category
- Populate `form_cues` with the key cues discussed during the session
- Populate `common_mistakes` if any form issues came up during the session
- Populate `current_working` with the weight/rep ranges from the current session (e.g. "3×15 @ 15lb" or "bodyweight, 5 reps"); for stretches, note hold duration (e.g. "30s each side")
- Populate `personal_notes` with any shoulder/grip/asymmetry notes specific to Kyle
- `progression` can be filled in if a clear next step was discussed, otherwise leave NULL
- After inserting, use the new ID to link `exercise_id` in the workout log
- After logging a session, update current_working on any existing exercises where the session reflects new weight/rep benchmarks or progression beyond what's currently recorded
- Keep `form_cues` concise (2-4 sentences max) — quick-reference setup, key positions, hold times
- Use `detailed_walkthrough` for in-depth breakdowns: step-by-step setup, variations, why certain cues matter, common compensation patterns. Only populate when an exercise has enough nuance to warrant it — not every exercise needs one.
- When updating an exercise's form_cues and the text is getting long or repetitive, move the detailed content to detailed_walkthrough and trim form_cues back to a summary.
